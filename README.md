Data engineering on Google Cloud Platform - my continued learning journey

This repo is for various use cases for working with data on GCP that help me learn: 
1) Real-time data pipeline using Pub/Sub, Apache Beam/Dataflow and BigQuery. 
2) Batch data processing using Dataproc.
3) Machine learning with BigQuery and AutoML.

The goal is to iterate through the use cases and continuously look for other ways to work with data on GCP. The data sources will vary from sample Google data to generating fake data using Python to resemble common datasources.
